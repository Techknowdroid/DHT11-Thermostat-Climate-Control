# DHT11-Thermostat-Climate-Control
DHT11 based thermostat to switch ON or OFF an Airconditioner by grabbing the room temperature at the start of the cycle. Then cooling the room by 2 degrees or as needed before cutting power to the Aircon. Then waiting for the temperature to rise by a set level before switching ON power to the Aircon again but not before a minimum amount of determined time has elapsed. To protect the Compressor from damage if switched on too soon.
